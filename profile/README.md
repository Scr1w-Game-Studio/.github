## Welcome to Scr1w Game Studio ðŸŽ®

> From cybersecurity to game design â€” weâ€™re here to build what we love.

Scr1w Game Studio is a non-professional game development group founded by former members of [Screw Cyber Security Studio](https://github.com/dlut-sss), a student organization of DLUT established in 2018.

Originally focused on cybersecurity, weâ€™ve since expanded our creative energy into independent game development â€” exploring mechanics, storytelling, and playful interaction. We may not be industry professionals, but we treat each project with heart and curiosity.

ðŸŽ¨ Whether it's prototypes, game jam entries, or just fun experiments â€” we make games because we love them.
